Flood is a simple puzzle game, which I have adapted for the Pebble Time (Basalt) platform.

Fill the board in as few moves as possible. Use the up and down buttons to change colors, and use select to pick. You have 26 moves to fill the board, or else it's game over!

The original ~~[Pebble Store](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/564c2acda9379f613e000044)~~ has been discontinued, but this app can be found in the [Rebble Store](http://store-beta.rebble.io/app/564c2acda9379f613e000044) archive. Thanks [Rebble](https://rebble.io/)!
